I am Jonah or Jones as many people call me I love soccer and scoring crazy deals on Ebay.
I am married with a one year old daughter, Madison and Tempest are their names.
I like to read science fiction and watch all kinds of foreign films. 
I am not good at asking for help on my coding projects but I'm working on that.
